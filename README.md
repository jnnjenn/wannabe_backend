Technical Challenge: Backend Software Engineering

Welcome to your technical challenge.
This challenge is to validate your ability as a Backend Software Engineer with Wannabe.

**Deadline:** Monday, November 28th, 2022. 11:59 PM CDMX Time.

For this challenge, we expect you to develop an API on Node.js that allows you to create, update, delete and get the data about airports, airlines, and flights attached to this email.

**Your app must have the following:**
- You have to choose the stack you will use and why you chose it.
- The API must have documentation on how to use it as if you are delivering this API to a Frontend Developer.
- We must integrate with a PostgreSQL database and build seeders to populate the database with the data we attach to this email.
- Proper use of git. Please don ́t upload your project to GitHub with just one commit; we want to see how you use GitHub and how you document each change in your code.

Good Luck!
